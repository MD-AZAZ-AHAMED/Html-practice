                <b>Load shedding, power loss, and electric outage- whatever you name it;
                it has become a daily occurrence of our life</b>. Load shedding means
                uncertainty, suspension, and a short supply of electricity for a 
                <em>certain time being</em>. Generally due to comparatively less power production
                than the increasing demand load shedding happens. Other causes of this
                serious issue are the illegal connection and misuse of electricity. 
                To maintain the flow of electricity in some areas, the power authority
                disconnects the supply of <i>electricityein other areas.
                Which makes the power cut area plunged into darkness and all the works
                standstill</i>. In our daily life, it is a very common scene now and is
                getting worse day by day. But its consequences are much worse than
                are affecting our everyday life.<strong>Load shedding is a piece of bad
                news to the residential sector, educational institutions, medical
                sectors, local businesses, offices and factories, and agriculture</strong>.
