    Load shedding, power loss, and electric outage- whatever you name it;<br> 
     it has become a daily occurrence of our life. Load shedding means<br>
     uncertainty, suspension, and a short supply of electricity for a <br>
     certain time being. Generally due to comparatively less power production<br>
      than the increasing demand load shedding happens. Other causes of this<br>
      serious issue are the illegal connection and misuse of electricity. <br>
      To maintain the flow of electricity in some areas, the power authority<br>
      disconnects the supply of electricity in other areas.<br>
    Which makes the power cut area plunged into darkness and all the works<br>
    standstill. In our daily life, it is a very common scene now and is<br>
     getting worse day by day. But its consequences are much worse than<br>
     are affecting our everyday life. Load shedding is a piece of bad<br>
     news to the residential sector, educational institutions, medical<br>
     sectors, local businesses, offices and factories, and agriculture.<br>
     brDue to light out the entire routine domestic lifestyle get stuck.<br>
     The students suffer before their exam nights or in attending class.
