             Aristotle(c. 384 B.C. to 322 B.C.) was an Ancient Greek philosopher and scientist
             who is still considered one of the greatest thinkers in politics, psychology and ethics.</q>
             Some of his most notable works include Nichomachean Ethics, Politics, Metaphysics, 
             Poetics and Prior Analytics.After Aristotle’s father died, Proxenus of Atarneus,  
             director of the academy, as many imagined he would.<br>

             What is logic for Aristotle? On Interpretation begins with a discussion of meaning, according to which written 
             words are symbols of spoken words, while spoken words are symbols of thoughts (Int.16a3–8). This theory 
             of signification can be understood as a semantics that explains how different alphabets can signify the 
             same spoken language, while different languages can signify the same thoughts. Moreover, this theory connects
             the meaning of symbols to logical consequence, since commitment to some set of utterances rationally requires 
             commitment to the thoughts signified by those utterances and to what is entailed by them. Hence, though Cook 
             Wilson (1926, 30–33) correctly notes that Aristotle nowhere defines logic, it may be called the science of 
             thinking, where the role of the science is not to describe ordinary human reasoning but rather to demonstrate 
             what one ought to think given one’s other commitments. Though the elements of Aristotelian logic are implicit 
            in our conscious reasoning, Aristotelian “analysis” makes explicit what was formerly implicit (Cook Wilson 1926, 49).<br>

             Aristotle shows how logic can demonstrate what one should think, given one’s commitments, by developing the 
             syntactical concepts of truth, predication, and definition. In order for a written sentence, utterance, or 
             thought to be true or false, Aristotle says, it must include at least two terms: a subject and a predicate. 
             Thus, a simple thought or utterance such as “horse” is neither true nor false but must be combined with another
             term, say, “fast” in order to form a compound—“the horse is fast”—that describes reality truly or falsely. The 
             written sentence “the horse is fast” has meaning insofar as it signifies the spoken sentence, which in turn has 
             meaning in virtue of its signifying the thought that the horse is fast (Int.16a10–18, Cat.13b10–12, DA 430a26–b1). 
             Aristotle holds that there are two kinds of constituents of meaningful sentences: nouns and their derivatives, which 
             are conventional symbols without tense or aspect; and verbs, which have a tense and aspect. Though all meaningful speech 
             consists of combinations of these constituents, Aristotle limits logic to the consideration of statements, which assert
             or deny the presence of something in the past, present, or future (Int.17a20–24). Aristotle shows how logic
