          Poetics and Prior Analytics.After Aristotle’s father died, Proxenus of Atarneus, 
          who was married to Aristotle’s older sister, Arimneste, became Aristotle’s guardian
           until he came of age When Aristotle turned 17, he enrolled in Plato’s Academy.In 338, he began tutoring 
          <blockquote>Alexander the Great. In 335, Aristotle founded his own school, the Lyceum, in Athens,

          . <blockquote cite=https://www.biography.com/scholar/aristotle> When Aristotle turned 17, Proxenus sent him to Athens to 
           pursue a higher education. At the time, Athens was considered the academic center 
           of the universe</blockquote>. In Athens, Aristotle enrolled in Plato’s Academy, Greek’s premier 
           learning institution, and proved an exemplary scholar. Aristotle maintained a 
           relationship with Greek philosopher Plato, himself a student of Socrates, and his 
           academy for two decades. <abbr title="WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION">WHO</abbr>  Plato died in 347 B.C. Because Aristotle had disagreed with 
           some of Plato’s philosophical treatises, Aristotle did not inherit the position of 
           director of the academy, as many imagined he would.
